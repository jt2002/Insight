# Insight - RecNet
Recommender System Powered by Deep Neural Network

## Motivation
- Build a flexible and extensible Recommender System using TensorFlow 2.0
- Deploy the Recommender app on AWS in Django framework
- The app makes REST API call to TensorFlow Serving with Docker
- Benchmark the system against another Machine Learning model

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Scikit-Learn
- Scikit-Surprise
- Pandas
- Numpy

## Data
- [Amazon Review Data (2018)](https://nijianmo.github.io/amazon/index.html)
  - [Book (ratings only)](http://deepyeti.ucsd.edu/jianmo/amazon/categoryFilesSmall/Books.csv)
